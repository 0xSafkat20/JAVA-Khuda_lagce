# Food Ordering System - Java Project

## Overview
This project is a Java-based Food Ordering System that allows customers to order food, sellers to post their food items, and admins to manage the system. The project features a GUI built using `Swing` for user interaction. This system is suitable for online food delivery services where customers, sellers, and admins have distinct roles and functionality.

## Features
- **Customer**: Customers can browse food items, place orders, and make payments.
- **Seller**: Sellers can add, update, and manage the food items they offer for sale.
- **Admin**: Admins can maintain the overall site, including managing users and handling orders.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **Swing**: Used for building the graphical user interface.
- **JDBC (optional)**: For database connectivity (if needed for user data, order details, etc.).
  
## Project Structure
- `AdminLogin.java`: Admin login functionality.
- `CustomerDashboard.java`: Main page for customer actions like viewing menus and placing orders.
- `SellerDashboard.java`: Sellers can manage food items, including adding and updating food products.
- `AdminDashboard.java`: Admin's management interface to oversee users and orders.
- `LogInPage.java`: A login page that provides access for all types of users (admin, customer, seller).
